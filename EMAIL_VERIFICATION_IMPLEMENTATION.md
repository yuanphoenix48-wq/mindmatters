2. Choose your email provider (Gmail, SendGrid, etc.)
3. Update `SITE_URL` for your domain
4. Test the configuration using the provided tools

## Email Providers Supported

- Host: smtp.gmail.com
- Port: 587
- Requires app password (not regular password)

### SendGrid
- Professional email service
- High deliverability
- Good for production

### Outlook/Hotmail
- Microsoft's email service
- Good alternative to Gmail

### Mailtrap
- Perfect for development/testing
- Catches emails without sending

## Database Schema
The system requires these columns in the `users` table:
- `email_verified` (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT FALSE)
- `verification_token` (VARCHAR(64))
- `verification_expires` (DATETIME)

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files
- `includes/EmailVerification.php` - Enhanced functionality
- `email_config.php` - Better configuration options
- `signupapi.php` - Improved error handling
- `resend_verification.php` - Enhanced user experience
- `admin_add_user.php` - Added email verification for therapists

### New Files
- `test_email_verification.php` - Comprehensive testing tool
- `verify_email_setup.php` - Quick setup checker
- `EMAIL_VERIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Unchanged Files
- `verify_email.php` - Still works with new system
- `loginapi.php` - Already had proper verification checks
- `index.php` - Signup modal unchanged (works with new backend)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Email configuration invalid"**
   - Check `email_config.php` settings
   - Ensure all required constants are defined

2. **"SMTP connection failed"**
   - Verify SMTP credentials
   - Check firewall/network settings
   - Try different port (465 for SSL, 587 for TLS)

3. **"Verification email not received"**
   - Check spam/junk folder
   - Verify email address is correct
   - Use resend verification feature
   - Check error logs

### Debug Mode
Set `$this->mailer->SMTPDebug = 2;` in EmailVerification.php for detailed SMTP debugging.

## Production Deployment

1. Update `SITE_URL` in `email_config.php`
2. Use production email service (SendGrid recommended)
3. Set up proper SSL certificates
4. Test thoroughly with real email addresses
5. Monitor error logs
6. Remove or secure test files

## Security Considerations

- Tokens are cryptographically secure (64 random bytes)
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Email addresses are validated
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting on login attempts
- Secure password requirements

## Performance

- Minimal database queries
- Efficient token generation
- Optimized email templates
- Connection pooling support
- Error handling without blocking

The email verification system is now production-ready and significantly more reliable than the previous implementation.
